MiSTer has the ability to capture screenshots of a running core. This is useful for many things, including "saving" passwords.

Press **Win** + **Print Screen (âŒ˜ + F13)**

The snapshots are captured directly from the core video output before it is scaled and any filters are applied -- i.e., it saves at the core's native video resolution.

Output files are stored in /media/fat/screenshots/

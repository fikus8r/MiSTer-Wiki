MiSTer is fully open source project and will remain open.
This is my hobby and i'm getting fun to make hardware and software for this project. While software part just requires time, hardware requires money as well. To release a working add-on i have to make some test samples. Sometimes disaster happens and some equipment/device dies during experiments. Some bought devices/components intended to be MiSTer companions turned to be useless. So i have to try many options before give advice to users.

I'm not a big fan of asking donation for hobby projects, but this project sometimes requires investment to develop. It's absolutely voluntary, you don't have to. But if you satisfied my work and would be glad to donate, then here is my Paypal:
